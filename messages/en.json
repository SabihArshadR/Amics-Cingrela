    "ar": {
      "q1": "What is augmented reality (AR) and how do we use it here?",
      "a1": "Augmented reality is a technology that allows digital elements—such as characters, objects, or scenes—to be superimposed on the real environment through your mobile camera. In this game, it is used to view Roc, collect volcanic rocks, and see the findings.",
      "q2": "Do I need to download any app?",
      "a2": "No. This is a web application (webapp): you just need to access the link through your browser (Chrome, Safari...). Nothing needs to be downloaded.",
      "q3": "Is my phone compatible with AR?",
      "a3": "It works with most recent devices that have a camera and an updated browser. You need to allow camera access. If you have issues, try another browser or device.",
      "q4": "I see nothing when I open the camera. What can I do?",
      "a4": "Make sure that:\n\n● You have physically reached the correct point on the map (geolocation).\n● You have granted camera access.\n● There is enough light around.\nIf it still doesn't work, close and reopen the browser.",
      "q5": "Is an internet connection required to use AR?",
      "a5": "Yes. AR loads in the browser, so you need mobile data or Wi-Fi during the experience.",
      "q6": "Is it safe to use AR while walking?",
      "a6": "Yes, but be aware of your surroundings while using the camera. Don't walk looking at your phone and always keep an eye on your environment.",
      "q7": "Can I take photos or videos with AR?",
      "a7": "Yes! You can take screenshots and record videos with Roc and the different AR experiences and share them. It's a great way to remember and share your adventure."
    },
    "game": {
      "q1": "What is the goal of the game?",
      "a1": "The goal is to discover the hidden secrets of the basalt cliff by completing AR challenges. Along the way, you'll collect volcanic rocks and earn unique findings.",
      "q2": "What’s the difference between a rock and a finding?",
      "a2": "Volcanic rocks are natural elements you collect through interactive AR challenges.\nFindings are cultural or symbolic items you get by completing the challenges and quizzes.",
      "q3": "How do I collect rocks and findings?",
      "a3": "You must physically reach the geolocated points on the map. There, Roc will tell a story and give you an interactive challenge and a question. If you complete them, you'll receive the rocks and the finding for that point.",
      "q4": "What happens if I fail a challenge or a question?",
      "a4": "Interactive challenges are passed by collecting a certain number of volcanic rocks with AR. In all cases...",
      "q5": "Do I need to register to play?",
      "a5": "Yes, registration is required to participate in the game, access AR points, and unlock rocks and findings. It lets us save your progress, personalize the experience, and ensure the system works correctly. Registration is quick and only needs to be done once.",
      "q6": "Can I play in a group or with my family?",
      "a6": "Yes! The game is designed for group play: with friends, family, or school. You only need one phone or tablet per team and the desire to explore together.",
      "q7": "How long does the game last?",
      "a7": "It depends on your pace. The full route usually takes 60 to 90 minutes, but you can do it all at once or split it over time."
    },
    "map": {
      "q1": "How does the game map work?",
      "a1": "The interactive map shows geolocated points along the route. AR content only unlocks when you physically reach a point.",
      "q2": "Is geolocation required on my phone?",
      "a2": "Yes. Without geolocation enabled, you cannot play. The system needs to know your location to verify you've reached each point. We recommend turning on location before starting.\n\nHow to enable geolocation:\n\n**On Android:**\n1. Open your device settings.\n2. Go to Location.\n3. Enable Location.\n4. Ensure your browser has location permissions:\n   - Settings > Apps > [Browser Name] > Permissions > Location > Allow always or While using.\n\n**On iPhone:**\n1. Open Settings.\n2. Go to Privacy & Security > Location Services.\n3. Enable Location Services.\n4. Check your browser settings (Safari or Chrome).\n5. Ensure location is allowed during use.",
      "q3": "What if the map doesn't detect me correctly?",
      "a3": "● Make sure your location is enabled (see steps above).\n● Refresh your browser page.",
      "q4": "Is an internet connection required to use the map?",
      "a4": "Yes. The webapp needs an active connection to display the map and verify your location. However, data usage is very low.",
      "q5": "The map says I'm not at the right spot, but I am. What can I do?",
      "a5": "● Move slightly around the area: sometimes GPS needs a few seconds.\n● Ensure you're not under a structure or indoors.\n● Make sure you have a good GPS or mobile signal.",
      "q6": "Can I do the route in any order?",
      "a6": "No. The route is linear. You must follow the established order of points since each challenge and finding depends on the previous point. The map will only show the next unlocked point—you can't proceed without completing the current one."
